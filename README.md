# Pet-Project-Playground
Welcome to the Pet-Project-Playground! This repository is a collection of my personal projects, each one reflecting a unique aspect of my coding journey and interests. From experimental apps and utility tools to creative coding challenges and learning exercises, this repository is my digital sandbox. Here, you'll find a variety of projects in different stages of development—some are polished and complete, while others are rough drafts that show my progress and learning process.

Jan Nowak has established his own mobile phone manufacturing company, aiming to compete with giants like Apple, Samsung, and others in the fiercely competitive mobile market. Recognizing the complexities of pricing in such a saturated environment, Jan has embarked on a comprehensive data collection initiative. His goal is to understand the relationship between the technical features of mobile phones (such as RAM, internal storage, etc.) and their market price segments.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze various mobile phones sold by different companies to uncover patterns and features that influence their price brackets. By doing so, Jan hopes to strategically position his own products by identifying the key characteristics that distinguish mobile phones in various price ranges. This analysis will involve collecting data on specifications, sales figures, and price points across the market to create a predictive model that helps Jan make informed pricing decisions for his products.
# webscrapping_gulfood.ipynb
The Gulfood exhibition is one of the world's largest annual food and beverage trade shows, featuring a vast array of exhibitors and products from around the globe. This project aims to harness the power of web scraping to gather detailed information from the Gulfood database, providing a rich dataset for market analysis and business strategy development.

Utilizing Python’s Beautiful Soup library, the project will focus on extracting comprehensive data points such as exhibitor names, product details, country of origin, and contact information. This automated data collection will allow for efficient and accurate analysis of current food and beverage trends, potential new markets, and key industry players.
